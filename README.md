# Chunker

This chunker is a simple PHP script written in PHP 7 that aims to implement the chunk parsing approach to text analysis.
The fundamental idea behind this approach is to see sentences as combinations of different units of meaning and not as only a succession of words.
More information can be found in the article "Language as chunks, not words" (2002) by Dr Krishnamurthy.

## Getting Started

To try out this script, simply launch it from a server that supports PHP7 (many free softwares exists to simulate a local server on your machine, such as WAMP for instance). 
By default the text and the rules are in French, but you can change them at any time.
* On the main box you can input your own text to analyse.
* On the other box, you can create rules that will constrain the parsing of the input text.

### Prerequisites

A machine that supports PHP7 and HTML5.

## Built With

* [WAMP Server] (http://www.wampserver.com/) - local test server
